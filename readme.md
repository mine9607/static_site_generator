## Build a Static Site Generator

A ssg takes raw content files (like markdown and images) and turns them into a static website

### Static vs Dynamic Sites:

Users cannot:
    - Upload files
    - Log in
    - Leave comments
    - Save preferences

HTML is a tree-like structure where each "tag" can contain other tags.
